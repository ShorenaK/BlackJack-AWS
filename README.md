## Shorena K. Anzhilov  CS5001_Final_Project - "BlackJack Game"

# Game Descriptiion:

The "BlackJack" card game is tailored for one player competing against the dealer. The game begins with the player clicking the "Kick off the game" button, prompting the shuffling of two cards for each participant. The objective is to beat the dealer by achieving a score as close to 21 as possible or hitting 21 itself.

After the initial card deal, players can draw a new card using the "New Card" button. If the cumulative card value exceeds 21, the player receives a "Bust! You lost a Bet!" message. Achieving a card value of 21 results in a victory for the player, with an additional 50 chips added to their total. Players start with 1000 chips, and winning earns them 50 chips, while losing deducts 50 chips.

Card values from 2 to 10 correspond to their face value, and Jack, Queen, and King are valued at 10. The default value of an Ace is set to 11 but can be changed to one. Notably, the game uses a unique approach, displaying only numerical representations.

In case of a tie, where both the player and the dealer have the same card value, a "It's a TIE" message is displayed. If the dealer hits Black Jack, the player automatically loses, with 50 chips deducted and the message "'Table Wins Black Jack!!!"

A third button is incorporated for navigation to the main page, serving as the entrance to the casino and the starting point to enter Shorena's Black Jack Table.
